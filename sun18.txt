A COUPLE who were in "sickening" debt and spending £1,300 on food a month were shown a series of nifty tricks to save them over £1,000.  Matt and Neil, who are parents to five-year-old son Thomas, racked up around £9,000 of credit card debt during the Covid crisis last year. Featuring in the latest episode of Channel 4's How to Save a Grand in 24 Hours, the couple said their finances were hit further when Neil lost his job at a local restaurant.  They discovered they were paying £1,800 a year on interest repayments on their debts - and wanted to pay this off quicker to save thousands.  The main thing the couple were spending big on each month was their grocery bill.  They would often opt for pricey takeaways - even though they already had food in the fridge - and buy extra food at the shops when they didn't need to.   As a result, their food bill for the month would hit a mammoth £1,300 per month, £320 of which went towards takeaways.  The hosts of the show showed the couple a series of simple money saving hack, which in total, has put £1,117 back into their pockets per month. The couple were told to drastically cut down the number of times they were taking a trip to the shops.  They were both visiting the supermarket nearly 30 times per month, splashing cash each time on food.
