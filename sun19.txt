Sunburn is also a risk factor for skin cancer, with each episode raising the odds even more. Getting sunburn just once every two years can triple your risk of melanoma skin cancer, compared to never being burnt, according to Cancer Research UK.  Danielle says she has contacted Malibu regarding their product and she's currently in the process of filing a complaint.  The London-based company has stressed the importance of correctly applying their products and claim the majority of the public don't realise how much protection they need to apply.  A Malibu spokesperson said: "We await Danielleâ€™s completed complaints form.  "As a company we adhere and conform to all UK and European regulations. Our product formulations go through stringent testing to gain their SPF claim and we operate strict quality control in house.  "When a sun protection cream/lotion is tested a certain amount is applied to a certain area of skin. The skin is exposed to artificial sunlight for a certain amount of time and depending on how the skin behaves determines the SPF.  "A normal fair skinned person would burn in 10 minutes without suncare. If they use SPF30 this will give them 30 times longer in the sun before burning than without use (no matter how many times it's applied). This equates to 300 minutes, five hours.
