A huge yellow-and-blue event arena along with a blue-and-white music tent were put in place at the Suffolk festival based at Henham Park.  It is the first major event to take place since the Government lifted all social distancing guidelines and the majority of coronavirus restrictions.  The four-day festival, which begins today, is the first music event of 2021 in the nation to be running at full capacity.  Anyone attending the festival must show proof of a negative lateral flow test or of double vaccination - meaning they can dance and hug safely.   Headliners include The Chemical Brothers, Wolf Alice, Fontaines D.C and Pompeii singers Bastille.
