SCOTTISH singer Tallia Storm showed off her bum in a bizarre pair of camouflage trousers today as she left her BUILD Series interview in London.  The 20-year-old songstress made sure to command attention in the peculiar pants, which boasted an unfortunate nude-coloured patch across her derriere. The singer teamed her unusual chap-style bottoms with a matching black shirt with metallic orange patches across the chest.  Teasing her cleaving in the unbuttoned garment, she wrapped a wet-look padded jacket around her as she pulled her designer luggage behind her from the studio.  Tallia accessorised her utility-inspired ensemble with a pair of sky-high heels with neon detailing.  The reality star completed the look by styling her hair into loose curls, and worked a bold red lip. Tallia's appearance comes as she has been grieving the loss of her Celebs Go Dating co-star Mike Thalassitis, after he was found hanged last month following a secret six-month battle with depression.  When the Love Island star's tragic death was confirmed, the singer shared a collage of pictures from their time filming the E4 show. Alongside the post, she penned an emotional tribute in which she spoke about his "infectious laugh" and "cheeky smile".
