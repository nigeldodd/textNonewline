A FURIOUS mum has been left stranded in Majorca after her 13-year-old daughter was ordered to isolate for 21 days in a bizarre new Covid rule.  April Allinson's holiday in Port d'Alcudia with her daughter, Ellie, and her pal Lilly Cuthbert turned into a living nightmare after the 30-year-old mum picked up the virus. After 10 days of isolation in their hotel room following April's positive test, the trio were set to be freed on Friday and fly home to the UK on Saturday.  But Spanish cops have now said the two 13-year-old girls must stay put for another 10 days, bringing the total isolation period in the tiny hotel room to 21 days.  April, from Stockton-On-Tees, said the authorities have ruled the two young girls could have caught Covid while in isolation with April and therefore must remain on the island.  April has already forked out more than £1,700 for the hotel - and she hasn't even started to add up the hit to earnings from her aesthetics business back home.   And the family must find another £766 if they have to remain in isolation even longer.  "I don’t understand what’s going on and the rules seem to change by the minute," April told The Sun.  "This isn’t what we were told and neither child has ever tested positive throughout. I don’t understand the reasoning at all."
