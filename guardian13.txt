The start time for the Olympic tennis event will be pushed back four hours from 11am to 3pm from Thursday after numerous players struggled in the Tokyo heat and humidity on Wednesday.  “The decision to start matches at 3pm JST from Thursday is possible due to the outcomes of today’s matches across the five competitions being staged and the size of player field and is designed to further safeguard player health,” said the ITF in a statement.  The decision came on a day in which numerous players were negatively affected, including Paula Badosa of Spain who was forced to retire from her quarter-final due to a heat-related illness and Daniil Medvedev who edged into the quarterfinal despite again struggling in conditions he previously called “some of the worst (heat) I’ve ever had.” As Diego Schwartzman lost to Karen Khachanov in conditions that reached 31°C with around 72% humidity, he criticized the officials for being out of touch with reality: “The schedules are decided while sitting on the couch with livescores,” he said.  After his opening match, Medvedev had suggested a later start in line with other tournaments played in such humid conditions. Novak Djokovic agreed with him and suggested a 3pm start. Now it is a reality.
