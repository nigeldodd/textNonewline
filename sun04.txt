Glamorous Kim and their four children were the star guests as Kanye played songs containing a raft of emotional outbursts and admissions of his own “lies” and mistakes — in what increasingly felt like a direct message to his wife.  It was his first opportunity to have his say in public on the break-up, which followed months of bizarre outbursts and mental health struggles.  Taking to the stage in Atlanta, Georgia, to present new track Welcome To My Life, he wailed: “I’m losing my family, God how could you leave? I hid a hundred lies but I repent for everything and I’m going to do it again.”  The song begins with a speech from his mother Donda, who died in 2007 following a number of cosmetic surgeries.   Kanye, 44, later rapped that he went into “deep depression” after her death, before playing clips in which she says: “Two lessons my father passed along to his children.  “The first is that no matter what, you never abandon your family. The second is that no matter what, you must love unconditionally.”  'HUNDRED LIES'  In another track Kanye jibes again at Kim: “I don’t care about the lawyer fees, I don’t care about your loyalties,” while in New Again he admits: “I hid a hundred lies.”
