Something for everyone  Space Jam: A New Legacy is directed by Malcolm D. Lee, who previously helmed numerous hits including Girls Trip. It has been put together with terrific attention to detail.  In the scene where LeBron is propelled into the digital universe, he hurtles past a collection of themed planets including Westeros, home of Game of Thrones; The Matrix; and The Wizard of Oz. And in the run-up to the big game there are lots of lovely in-jokes. Look closely at the crowds and you’ll spot countless familiar figures (space) jammed in, including Batman, The Flintstones, The Mask and many more.  This is truly a film with something in it for every family member, whatever their age. The pace never lets up as the action shuttles between real life and animation. We even get to see LeBron being “Tuneified” – turned into a cartoon character, which is not something you see on the big screen every day.  You certainly don’t need to be a basketball buff to enjoy this movie. Or know your alley-oop from your zone defence.  If you love cinema, you’ll be cock-a-hoop about Space Jam: A New Legacy.
