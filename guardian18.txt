all it the lockdown paradox: after spending so much time in isolation, adjusting to smaller lives, we may now be struggling to expand them.  Now that restrictions have been lifted, the pressure to pack our calendars, make the most of the summer and say yes to every invitation is coming up uncomfortably against a public that is not match-fit for marathon socialising. Even those butterflies who used to happily flit from event to event may now be finding one is enough.  Here’s how to not over do it.  Ease in gently Just because nightclubs are open does not mean you have to go. “It was a big transition in and it is going to be a big transition out,” says Beth Pickens, an arts consultant and author with a background in counselling. Her own re-entry into the world, after restrictions lifted in California, was to go to Disneyland. “That was insane,” she says (she blames her wife). “We went from zero to 100 – I realised I need to go to about 15.”  Pace yourself “Some people have just gone out and filled their social calendars, then gone: ‘Actually, I’m not quite ready for this,’” says Emily Syphas, a London-based life coach and founder of Sober and Social. She suggests starting out with just one event at the weekend – “instead of brunch, lunch, dinner, drinks ...” – as you feel out your threshold, and build up your stamina.
