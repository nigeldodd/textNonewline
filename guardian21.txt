I didn’t grow up with pets (I don’t think the dead spider I buried – paper gravestone and all – outside our house, aged five, counts). So I knew very little about dogs. But I did know this: I wanted a dog that wouldn’t wake up one day and decide to eat the children; I wanted a dog that doesn’t shed uncontrollably; and I wanted a dog that doesn’t smell. My last desire was futile. All dogs smell. I have come to terms with this. My home smelling of dog, however, is not something I embrace. I have childhood memories of going into homes where everything would smell of dog. Including the owner. I never wanted to be that person. So what to do? When we inherited our first dog, Oscar, my candle obsession went into overdrive. I did buy a dog deodorising spray, but Oscar hated it and our more recent dog, Flash, runs a mile at the sight of it. Extra baths are an option, but they encourage him to roll around in more filth. Recently, I discovered diffusers. Yes I know they have been around for ages, but I’d always associated them with cheap, nauseating, badly concocted potions. This new range from Jo Malone London, however, is exquisite. They come in a chic porcelain pot and the wonderfully fresh scents – there are a few to choose from – last four months. Which means, while your dog might smell from time to time, your house won’t.
