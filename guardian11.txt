Sophie Slater puts her clothes in the freezer. Or sprays them with a vodka and water solution. “And I often hang my dresses or blouses up in the shower to steam and air if they’ve been worn a few times,” she says, listing alternative techniques to using a washing machine. As the founder of the slow fashion brand Birdsong London, Slater recommends washing clothes as little as possible.  It’s easy to see why. Caring for our clothes – where washing is the dominant process – accounts for 25% of each garment’s carbon footprint. Yet, research from the charity Wrap shows that by increasing the life of all clothing by nine months – wearing what we own for longer, rather than sending it to landfill or buying new items – would reduce the annual carbon, water and waste footprint of clothing by 20-30% in the UK.  The challenge lies in keeping existing clothes looking fresh, without throwing them into the washing machine at the first sight of a dirty mark. In addition to Slater’s advice, simple steps such as skipping one in six washes, swapping every sixth dryer usage with open-air drying, and washing below 30C could save as much as 186 tonnes of carbon emissions, according to a report by the consultants McKinsey.
