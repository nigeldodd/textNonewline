In short, standard ice-cream is made with delicious, fat-rich ingredients such as cream and egg yolks. Tinned coconut milk is only 11% fat, and the bottled stuff a tenth of that, so on its own, it’s never going to give the rich mouthfeel of the things it’s replacing. One solution is, as Kaminsky suggests, to thicken the mixture with cornflour, which gives it a plump, slightly chewy consistency that proves a hit with my testers, but I find it’s more like frozen blancmange than custard (unsurprisingly, once you learn from her book Vegan Desserts that “this recipe was actually the result of a happy accident. Originally intended to become a pie filling, I hadn’t actually taken into account how much the piecrust would hold and was upset at first to discover that it wouldn’t all fit. Not one to toss perfectly good food, I decided to make a few more small tweaks to the remainder and then churn it into ice-cream.”).    If you want a more traditional texture, then, you’ll need more fat (look, I said this recipe was vegan; I didn’t say it was healthy). Falkowitz’s version is good, but even better is the one I happen upon by a Medium user, a vegan permaculturalist by the name of Violet Bee, who, after moving to a very rural farm, found herself frustrated by other people’s plant-based coconut ice-cream recipes, which, she says, always turned out either lumpy or grainy.
