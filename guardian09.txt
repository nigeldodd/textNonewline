“You have to give people a reason to come to an area,” says Melvyn Caplan, the council’s deputy leader. “They’re not just coming to Oxford Street for the shops any more. People are interested in experiences and destinations.” The pandemic has seen around 17% of stores on London’s most famous shopping street close completely.  The mound, it is hoped, is the kind of novelty experience that will lure people back to the West End, providing an opportunity for highly shareable Instagram moments, beyond selfies with armfuls of Selfridges bags. From Monday, having booked in advance and paid the £4.50–£8 ticket fee, visitors will be able to climb up a staircase that winds its way to the top of the scaffolding hill (or take the lift), enjoy elevated views of Hyde Park, post some pics, then descend a more fire escape-like staircase into an exhibition space and cafe. It is an extreme example of the kind of funfair brand of “experiential” urban set-dressing made popular by social media. But it was supposed to be even more radical.
