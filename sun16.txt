MCDONALD'S is axing three items including the BBQ bacon stack today as it shakes up its menu.  As part of the reshuffle, the fast food chain is also adding five new items to its menu for summer including a new burger and two flavours of McFlurry. But McDonald's lovers will no longer be able to order three of the menu items.  The Aero Chocolate and Aero Mint McFlurry flavours have been axed.  Also disappearing is the BBQ Bacon Stack, which became available in June.  But the fast food chain did say at the time that these would only be around for six weeks. McDonald's fans shared their disappointment on social media about the three items would not longer being available.

Limited time only?! You are a cruel master...." Kieran Ashton wrote: "I am begging McDonaldâ€™s to make the BBQ Bacon Stack a permanent feature on the menu."  Another user wrote about seizing the last opportunity to get the bacon stack before it ended.  He wrote: "Gonna get a Maccies for lunch today - really looking forward to it - after all it's my last chance to have a BBQ Bacon Stack as it ends on Tuesday"  The reshuffle comes just two weeks after the McSpicy was introduced to the line-up, delighting and disappointing fast food fans.
