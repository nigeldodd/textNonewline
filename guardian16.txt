Whenever I look back, the things I remember most about my childhood were those moments spent in and out of boredom, a kind of suspended time that only kids understand. Boredom was a portal. A place that opened up when the adult world was especially stifling, when my small, burgeoning interior life was frustrated at how grown-up clocks seemed to read time: forever oscillating between “just wait a minute” and “we’ll get there when we get there”. Like all kids I didn’t understand minutes, or hours – there was only activity and inactivity. I wrote about life in enormous batches, citing gaps of “12 years later” before I’d even lived six. For me, boredom was time distilled down to its purest form: all mine.  In a post-internet world, it’s easy to resist boredom. I can’t even pee without scrolling through Instagram. But I’m trying to let go of the panic that creeps in at the first sign of nothingness, and appreciate it for what it is: a luxury.  Whether it’s lying on the sofa, staring at the ceiling, or idly mapping out those fart-shapes, I let my mind wander the way it did when I was a kid in the hope that my imagination will unclench and I’ll finally remember some of those amazing pet dragon names.
