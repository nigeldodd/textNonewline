LIDSTAR, Glossier's popular seamless cream eye shadow has launched two new shades that are perfect for summer.  Available to buy from their website now, we can't wait to snap ours up. Lidstar is perfect for adding a touch of colour to your eyes with ease, and the two new summery shades will go perfectly with a tan. Available at glossier.com for £15, you can also buy the new duo together for £25 - saving you £5.  The new shades include Bun, a soft champagne with gold shimmer, and Branch, a rich bronze with gold pearl. Both shades were inspired by the "warm, flattering tones of evening light" and join the Lidstar line up that already includes Lily, Fawn, Cub, Moon, Herb and Slip.   Lidstar's buttery base gives a silky, blendable formula that swipes on easily and stays thanks to soft lock technology that stops it it creasing, fading, or smudging for 12 hours.  If you're wondering where you recognise the name from, Lidstar launched in 2018, and made it's pre-launch debut on none other than Beyonce, and also boasts celeb fans including Michelle Obama, Olivia Cooke, and Sydney Sweeney.
