From Bugs and Daffy to Porky Pig and Tweety, all your family’s favourite Looney Tunes heroes are in the mix for this funny, fast-paced family mash-up of live action, 2D animation and spectacular 3D CGI effects.  LeBron James stars as a dad who is perhaps a little too keen for his son, Dom (Cedric Joe), to follow in his acclaimed basketball footsteps. Dom, it’s clear, would rather follow his own dream to design video games. The two argue and that’s when things get a little weird…  Father and son take an elevator but get off on the wrong floor and find themselves suddenly plunged into a virtual server-verse, trapped by a rogue AI who wants to prove to LeBron that tech is mightier than real life. Evil mastermind Al G. Rhythm (Don Cheadle) holds Dom hostage and LeBron must take on a digital squad of hotshot basketball heroes (the Goon Squad) and win a match to get his son back.  Who has LeBron got on his team? Er, how about a motley crew of cartoon characters?  This reimagining of the 1996 hit Space Jam offers an all-new film experience perfect for getting back out to the cinema with your family this summer.  You don’t have to be a basketball whizz to enjoy the wisecracking thrills and spills of classic Loony Tunes humour mixed with warm-hearted drama as one of the greatest sports stars of all time has to win the match of his life!
