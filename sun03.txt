Hundreds of people gathered outside some clubs - including the Casino Room in Rochester, Kent - in a bid to join pals on the dancefloor.  Punters waited from 9pm to get into Astoria nightclub in Portsmouth to make the most of the night.  The club was expecting more than 2,000 people for the first big night in more than a year.  Bosses say every staff member has a Covid test before their shift.   The venue also has had the most NHS app check ins in the country, with the exception of concerts and sporting events this week, they say.  In Birmingham, girls posed for pictures as thousands of revellers descended onto Broad Street to make the most of their first week of freedom.  The sell-out event ‘Vodbull’ was on at Rosies nightclub, which was packed to the rafters with energetic partygoers.  The queue snaked round barriers - and club owners say the atmosphere was the same as New Year's Eve in 2019.  July 19 marked Freedom Day - the day where social distancing, working from home and compulsory face masks were scrapped.  And by midnight last Sunday, long queues had started to form outside venues with revellers keen to party away the memories of the past 18 months in lockdown.
